        <h1>Cooking with Daniel from Nada Surf</h1>
        <p>
            I had the pleasure of spending a crisp, Spring Day in Portsmouth, NH cooking and chatting
        <br> with Daniel Lorca of the band Nada Surf as he prepared a gourmet, sit-down dinner for 28 pals. 
        </p>

        <p>
            When I first invited Nada Surf to be on the show, I was told that Daniel Lorca was the guy
        <br> I wanted to talk to. Then Daniel emailed his response: " I'm way into it, but I don't want to 
        <br> talk about it, I wanna do it." After years of only having access to touring bands between their
        <br> sound check and set, Ive been doing a lot of
        <em>talking</em> about cooking with rockstars. 
        <br>To actually cook with a band was a dream come true. 
        </p>
        <h2>Six-Hour Salad</h2>
        <p>

        <p>
            Daniel prepared a salad of arugula, smoked tomatoes, tomato jam, and grilled avocado. (it's as good
       as it sounds!). I jokingly called a it a "6 - Hour Salad" because that's how long he worked on it. 
       The fresh tomatoes were slowly smoked over woodchips i the grill, and when they were softened, Daniel 
       separated out the seeds which he reduced into a smoky jame. The tomatoes were cute into strips to put 
       on the salads. As the day meandered, the avocados went on the grill after dark. I was on flashlight duty
       while Daniel checked for the perfect grill marks.
 </p>
       <p>
           I wrote up a streamlined adaptation of his recipe that requires
           <em>much</em>
           less time and serves 6 people instead of
           <em>five</em>
           times that amount.
       </p> 

       <h2>The Main Course</h2>
       <p>
           In addition to the smoky grilled salad, Daniel severed tarragon cornish hens with a cognac cream sauce
    <br>  loaded with chanterelles and grapes, and wild rice with grilled ramps (wild garlicky leeks). Dinner was 
    <br>  served close to midnight, but it was a party so no one cared.
       </p>
       <p>
           We left that night (technically early the next morning) with full bellies, new cooking tips, and nearly 5 
    <br>   hours of footage. I'm considering renaming the show "Cooking with Nada Surf".
